# BookTracker GUI
Made with TKinter, Matplotlib, and sqlite3 module in Python Standard Library:
- add, update, delete books to booklist
- find and add books from Google Books
- get reading stats in a form of a pie chart, a bar graph, and a table

## What I learned
- designed and placed elements on the GUI using TKinter
- created pie chart, bar graph, and table using Matplotlib (a plotting library for Python)
- set up database that stores book information
- performed CRUD operations while querying the database in SQL
- retrieved JSON data from Google Books API and parsed through it

## What I would like to add
-	books to read list
- timeline of when the books were read
- images of book thumbnails
- fix radio buttons
